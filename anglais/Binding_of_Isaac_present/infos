presentation strategy : 
    Why we can send our game ?
    - coded in Flash => very light, very adaptable, and you can play on windows or linux
    - The game-designer = Edmund McMillen. Success for super meat boy, his previous game. And there are coming elements of this game in BoI : key sounds, objects references, etc ...
    - game composed of references to the Biblical story. The univers is very dark, with adult themes = murder, infanticid, religion affectivement (pas sur de ce mot),
							  But graphics are made in a cartoon style => more accessible.
    - Dark universe strengthened (renforc√©) by Alarming music. Composed by Danny Baranowsky
    - procedurally-generated levels + random monsters and rewards = high play-time
    - selling place = the web !! Two plateforms = steam, with more than 100 millions of players, and the famous steam sales (object "Steam Sales")
						  - The humble Bundles, on the website humblebundle.com. a series of collections (bundles) of digital creations, send to a price determined by the purchaser (with a minimum).As it's a pack, we can sell our game even thought the purchaser doesn't want to play with it in the first place.
